## Study guide

> Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/OfVllex.png)

**Q: For interviews, do I need to know everything here?**

**A: No, you don't need to know everything here to prepare for the interview**.

What you are asked in an interview depends on variables such as:

* How much experience you have
* What your technical background is
* What positions you are interviewing for
* Which companies you are interviewing with
* Luck

More experienced candidates are generally expected to know more about system design.  Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.

Start broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.

* **Short timeline** - Aim for **breadth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **some** interview questions.
* **Medium timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **some depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **many** interview questions.
* **Long timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **more depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **most** interview questions.

## How to approach a system design interview question

> How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an **open-ended conversation**.  You are expected to lead it.

You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) section using the following steps.

### Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions

Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

* Who is going to use it?
* How are they going to use it?
* How many users are there?
* What does the system do?
* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
* How much data do we expect to handle?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?

### Step 2: Create a high level design

Outline a high level design with all important components.

* Sketch the main components and connections
* Justify your ideas

### Step 3: Design core components

Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to [design a url shortening service](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md), discuss:

* Generating and storing a hash of the full url
    * [MD5](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) and [Base62](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)
    * Hash collisions
    * SQL or NoSQL
    * Database schema
* Translating a hashed url to the full url
    * Database lookup
* API and object-oriented design

### Step 4: Scale the design

Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using [principles of scalable system design](#index-of-system-design-topics).

### Back-of-the-envelope calculations

You might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for the following resources:

* [Use back of the envelope calculations](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/1/26/google-pro-tip-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-to-choo.html)
* [Powers of two table](#powers-of-two-table)
* [Latency numbers every programmer should know](#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)

## System design topics: start here

New to system design?

First, you'll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)

* Topics covered:
    * Vertical scaling
    * Horizontal scaling
    * Caching
    * Load balancing
    * Database replication
    * Database partitioning

### Step 2: Review the scalability article

[Scalability](http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability)

* Topics covered:
    * [Clones](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
    * [Databases](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
    * [Caches](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
    * [Asynchronism](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we'll look at high-level trade-offs:

* **Performance** vs **scalability**
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.

Then we'll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.

## Performance vs scalability

A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.<sup><a href=http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html>1</a></sup>

Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

### Source(s) and further reading

* [A word on scalability](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html)
* [Scalability, availability, stability, patterns](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)

## Latency vs throughput

**Latency** is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.

**Throughput** is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.

Generally, you should aim for **maximal throughput** with **acceptable latency**.

### Source(s) and further reading

* [Understanding latency vs throughput](https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/sd/archive/2010/09/13/understanding-latency-vs-throughput)

## Availability vs consistency

### CAP theorem

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/bgLMI2u.png">
  <br/>
  <i><a href=http://robertgreiner.com/2014/08/cap-theorem-revisited>Source: CAP theorem revisited</a></i>
</p>

In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:

* **Consistency** - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
* **Availability** - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
* **Partition Tolerance** - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures

*Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance.  You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.*

#### CP - consistency and partition tolerance

Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.

#### AP - availability and partition tolerance

Responses return the most recent version of the data available on the a node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.

AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for [eventual consistency](#eventual-consistency) or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.

* [CAP FAQ](https://github.com/henryr/cap-faq)

## Consistency patterns

With multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data.  Recall the definition of consistency from the [CAP theorem](#cap-theorem) - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

### Weak consistency

After a write, reads may or may not see it.  A best effort approach is taken.

This approach is seen in systems such as memcached.  Weak consistency works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, and realtime multiplayer games.  For example, if you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few seconds, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.

### Eventual consistency

After a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds).  Data is replicated asynchronously.

This approach is seen in systems such as DNS and email.  Eventual consistency works well in highly available systems.

### Strong consistency

After a write, reads will see it.  Data is replicated synchronously.

This approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes.  Strong consistency works well in systems that need transactions.

### Source(s) and further reading

* [Transactions across data centers](http://snarfed.org/transactions_across_datacenters_io.html)

## Availability patterns

There are two main patterns to support high availability: **fail-over** and **replication**.

### Fail-over

#### Active-passive

With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby.  If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.

The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby.  Only the active server handles traffic.

Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.

#### Active-active

In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.

If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers.  If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.

Active-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.

### Disadvantage(s): failover

* Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.
* There is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.

### Replication

#### Master-slave and master-master

This topic is further discussed in the [Database](#database) section:

* [Master-slave replication](#master-slave-replication)
* [Master-master replication](#master-master-replication)


## Reverse proxy (web server)

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/n41Azff.png">
  <br/>
  <i><a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Reverse_proxy_h2g2bob.svg>Source: Wikipedia</a></i>
  <br/>
</p>

A reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public.  Requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before the reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client.

Additional benefits include:

* **Increased security** - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
* **Increased scalability and flexibility** - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
* **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
    * Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server
* **Compression** - Compress server responses
* **Caching** - Return the response for cached requests
* **Static content** - Serve static content directly
    * HTML/CSS/JS
    * Photos
    * Videos
    * Etc

### Load balancer vs reverse proxy

* Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers.  Often, load balancers  route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.
* Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.
* Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.

### Disadvantage(s): reverse proxy

* Introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.
* A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a [failover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover)) further increases complexity.

## Appendix

You'll sometimes be asked to do 'back-of-the-envelope' estimates.  For example, you might need to determine how long it will take to generate 100 image thumbnails from disk or how much memory a data structure will take.  The **Powers of two table** and **Latency numbers every programmer should know** are handy references.

Handy metrics based on numbers above:

* Read sequentially from disk at 30 MB/s
* Read sequentially from 1 Gbps Ethernet at 100 MB/s
* Read sequentially from SSD at 1 GB/s
* Read sequentially from main memory at 4 GB/s
* 6-7 world-wide round trips per second
* 2,000 round trips per second within a data center
